<p>So on average the common dorm room costs $720 a month. so that doesnt leave me with much money left. It is enough for the asian diet (white rice and ramen) which I would be expecting to eat in college anyway. But with all that I am not left with a lot of money. Even with all that I would still need supplies such as toilet paper. Seeing as I probably wont have a car in college, I will be using the first month to just buy all the essentials I will need to just live on and hopefully maybe have about $100 left. This month is used making sure I have all the essentials. This is what I would be spending on month 1:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Food - $350</li>
	<li>Dorm Room - $720</li>
	<li>Enterteinment (Netflix & Youtube Red) - $19</li>
	<li>Phone Bill - $60</li>
	<li>Toiletries - $50</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing the list I figured out that I will actually have no money left. But the nice part is that I will have an extra $50 next month... All of these things are MONTHLY costs except for toiletries. If I use that strategically I can gather money from saving.</p>
