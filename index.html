<h2>What You Should Do</h2>

<p id="what">To be clear, the best way to keep the irus from spreading is to NOT PANIC. Panicing will only make things worse and make everything spread even more. It is best to keep calm and make sure you have the esentials that you need on a day to day basis. Like what some of theses sources are saying, some of the best ways to avoid catching the virus is to stay away from people. The key components are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Washing your hands</li>
	<li>Keep your hands to yourself</li>
	<li>Keep your hands off your face</li>
	<li>Dont go into crowds too much</li>
	<li>Avoid too public places.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to do everyday things, you will need to do it on your own terms. At your house to stay the safest. Some exercizes you can do is walk, it is still safe to walk outside, just stay away (recommended 6 ft) from everyone. There are pushups, and other physical exercises that will benefit your health.</p>

<h2 id="plan">My Plan</h2>

<p>
What I plan on doing is just kinda relaxing. I dont have much to do in my house but to play video games. Since I have my desktop I can play video games all day every day. I hope I can force myself to do something else. Maybe do something with coding or make a passion project. I just want to do something productive (hoppefully). I have enough recources at my home to last a while. So all I have to do is force myself to do soemthing useful or cool. maybe aquire a new skill.

<h2 id="tap"> My Thoughts and Opinions </h2>

<p>
Honestly, people at this point have a good reason to panic but too much is bad. Which is what is happenning. People everywhere are raiding stores making sure that they have toilet paper or food and goods. Its good to prepare but p[eople are preparing far too much. The virus itself is not as dangerous as people think but it is scary. So I understand why peoplpe are freaking out. At thje end of the day, you are probably safe, unless you are old you under the age of 5. So here's to hoping youre not.
