<h2>What You Should Do</h2>

<p id="what">To be clear, the best way to keep the irus from spreading is to NOT PANIC. Panicing will only make things worse and make everything spread even more. It is best to keep calm and make sure you have the esentials that you need on a day to day basis. Like what some of theses sources are saying, some of the best ways to avoid catching the virus is to stay away from people. The key components are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Washing your hands</li>
	<li>Keep your hands to yourself</li>
	<li>Keep your hands off your face</li>
	<li>Dont go into crowds too much</li>
	<li>Avoid too public places.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to do everyday things, you will need to do it on your own terms. At your house to stay the safest. Some exercizes you can do is walk, it is still safe to walk outside, just stay away (recommended 6 ft) from everyone. There are pushups, and other physical exercises that will benefit your health.</p>
