  <h2>What I do when feeling stressed.</h2>

  <p>During these trying times we all need to do something that makes us feel safe when we are in "danger". I like to do a lot of things when I feel as if I am in need of comforting. Most of them include staying in and doing mostly nothing but they still help me.</p>

  <h3>What I like to do</h3>

  <ul>
<li>Play Video Games</li>
<li>Watch Youtube</li>
<li>Watch Netflix</li>
<li>Go for some anime</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Yes, this may seem like a little for anti-stress but it's what I like to do. I do these things becuase it takes my mind off things. It takes a lot of peoples minds off things. They are efficiient and really good at wasting time.</p>
