<h2>10 years later...</h2>

<p>After the whole "decline of the economy" we are back to where we were. Just for simplicity sake, lets say I went to a community college and was able to get enough scholarships to pay off my debts by the time I graduated. I really want to work at Behavior Interactive and willl hopefully be working there by then. That means I will be working at Montreal, Canada. Working there, I will be getting 4,500 us dollars a month. The average rent cost there is $1000. So essentially, I have 3,500 dollars to spend on anything a month. So the car I will be renting a month will be $359 a month. With the state taxes they will be taking $88 a month. So that means if you put it all together I will have a remaining $2593. With that I can save in a bank and let interest invest in itself. Entertainment will be $79 for youtube netflix and a phone bill. Whats left is 2,514. I can assume I will be paying for toiletries every month becasue I could. Thats another $50. So every month I could save $2,464. If I do that and spend $500 every month on food I still have enough to save for something later on. All that money will go into the bank for emergencies or if I just want something for myself. </p>
