<p>At this point some of the essentials should still be in supply so I would not need to spend money on that. But with all of my monthly expenses I would only be getting $50 a month. With that I dont know what I would buy. I would probably just save it for something better. So with this I have the option of having $100 next month or no money and waste it on something completely useless. In all honestly one of my favorite drinks is sparkling water. So I figure that making my own sparkling water at home would be the plan. If I have a roomate I would try to make him share the cost and we split it in some sort of way. We'll buy the sodastream so I can enjoy a nice sparkling water instead of buying a huge pack and creating garbage and depending on how we use it, waste money on sparkling water. Luckily the sodastream is a perfect $50 so I can buy one if I wanted to. Which I will.</p>
