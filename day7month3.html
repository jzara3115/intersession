<p>At this point I am at the same point from where I began. I am still at $50 at the end of the month. The question is what absolutely useless item I can buy for $50. But wait, I need to buy more supplies and toiletries. So I can use the $50 on things I need for the bathroom and cleaning. There is not much I can spoendit on anyway. The toiletries will last another 2 months depending on how I use it. At this point is is just a big cycle as to how I can save $50 a month. For future reference I can probably save the $50 for months and months and stockpile money. Eventually I can get enough money to buy something very useful. Or I can just keep spending it on stuff that gives no use. As long as I get the necesserary bills out of the way I can live care free. I can think of going cheapper for my phone plan and get a lot more money but I need my unlimited data. I can drop Youtube and Netflix but they are my main source of entertainment. And I can't have ads on my video. <strong>NO THANKS.</strong></p>
